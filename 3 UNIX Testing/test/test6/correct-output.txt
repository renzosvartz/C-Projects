----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please enter one dimension for two vectors X and Y.
The vector length must be at least 1 and at most 10.
Any non-numerical input will be ignored by the function's
input evaluation. Numbers outside of the bounds
1 and 10 will produce an error message and exit
the program.
This program initializes the length used in reference with vectors X and Y as 0.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please enter the length of vectors X and Y: 
You entered length: 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter the integers of Vector X, element by element, beginning at the first element
The first number detected by the program's input evaluation will be
evaluated to determine if it is less than 15446 because numbers greater
than or equal to 15446 may exceed the storage capability of integers on this machine.
Non-numerical input will be ignored by the program's input evaulation.
You will always be given another opportunity to enter an integer to fill your matrix
If the program reaches the end-of-file, the program will produce an error
message and terminate.
