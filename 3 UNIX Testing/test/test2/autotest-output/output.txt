Please enter one dimension for two vectors X and Y.
The vector length must be at least 1 and at most 10.
Any non-numerical input will be ignored by the function's
input evaluation. Numbers outside of the bounds
1 and 10 will produce an error message and exit
the program.
This program initializes the length used in reference with vectors X and Y as 0.
