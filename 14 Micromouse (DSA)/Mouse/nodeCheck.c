Purpose: check to see if the current location is a node
Status: finished, tested

NOTE: ONLY COMPATABLE IN SIMULATOR!! Need to translate and incorperate finished movement/sensor functions once algorithm in stable
NOTE: most of the simulator-based functions start with "API_" so any that have this prefix need to be replaced for the physical bot

#include "API.h" //only needed for simulator use

int nodeCheck()
{
	//count number of avalible paths
	int status, paths = 3;
	if(API_wallFront()) //NOTE: the simulator cannot detect walls that are not next to it (this implementation will need to change for physical bot)
		paths--;
	if(API_wallRight())
		paths--;
	if(API_wallLeft())
		paths--;

	//determine status
	switch (paths)
	{
		case 0: //deadend
			status = -1;
			break;
		case 1: //not a normal node: is it a corner or a clear path?
			status = 0; //assume it will be a clear path
			if(API_wallFront()) //corner condition
				status = 2;
			break;
		case 2: //is a node
			status = 1;

		case 3: //is also a node
